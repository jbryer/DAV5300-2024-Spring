## DAV 5300 Computational Mathematics and Statistics - Spring 2023

**Instructor:** Jason Bryer, Ph.D. [jason@bryer.org](mailto:jason@bryer.org)  
**Meeting Time:** Tuesdays 5:30pm to 7:30pm  
**Office Hours:** Before and after class and online by appointment  
**Teaching Assistant:** Dengyi Liu  

### Course Overview

Deeper math literacy and computational thinking are essential for deeper data literacy. Probability, statistics, and mathematics—especially fundamental linear algebra—are critical to the success of data analysts as they implement increasingly complex solutions. This course is designed to give the non-mathematician practice using mathematical and statistical computational methods in the service of data analytic solutions.

### Attendance

You are expected to attend class to learn the material for the course. Attendance will be recorded for each session. While one absence will not be a problem, several absences will be. That said, if your circumstances warrant missing class, please discuss with me as soon as possible.

### Textbooks

*Introduction to Modern Statistics* by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin freely available at:  - This will be the primary textbook.

*R for Data Science* by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund freely available at: https://r4ds.had.co.nz - Recommended reference for those new to R.

### University Policies and Resources

#### Accessibility and Accomodations

The Office of Disability Services collaborates with students, faculty, and staff to provide reasonable accommodations and services to students with disabilities.
